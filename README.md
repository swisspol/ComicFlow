Overview
========

Finally a comic reader for iPad done right! ComicFlow was designed with one goal in mind: providing the best experience for comic fans with large collections.

ComicFlow is also the first (and only?) open-source comic reader for iPad: the entire source code and graphic assets are available for anyone to look at or contribute.

This project relies on 2 open-source libraries:
  * [Cooliris ToolKit for iOS](https://github.com/swisspol/Cooliris-ToolKit)
  * [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer)
